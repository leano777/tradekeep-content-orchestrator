# Security Guidelines - TK Content Orchestrator

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the TK Content Orchestrator application and provides guidelines for maintaining secure operations.

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with secure token generation
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with predefined roles: ADMIN, MANAGER, EDITOR, VIEWER
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt with salt rounds
- **Session management** with automatic token expiration
- **Rate limiting** on authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks

### 2. Data Protection
- **Input validation** using express-validator on all endpoints
- **SQL injection prevention** through Prisma ORM parameterized queries
- **XSS protection** with input sanitization and output encoding
- **NoSQL injection prevention** using express-mongo-sanitize
- **Data encryption** for sensitive information in transit (HTTPS required in production)

### 3. Security Headers
Implemented via Helmet.js:
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS attacks
- **X-Frame-Options** to prevent clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options** to prevent MIME sniffing
- **Strict-Transport-Security** for HTTPS enforcement
- **X-XSS-Protection** for additional XSS protection

### 4. Rate Limiting
Different rate limits for various endpoints:
- General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- Authentication: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- API endpoints: 60 requests per minute
- File uploads: 10 uploads per minute

### 5. Error Handling
- **Centralized error handling** with sanitized error messages
- **No stack traces** exposed in production
- **Security audit logging** for sensitive operations
- **Graceful error recovery** without exposing system details

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required security environment variables
JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-string>
DATABASE_URL=<secure-database-connection>
SESSION_SECRET=<strong-random-string>
CORS_ORIGIN=<allowed-origins>
```

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase and lowercase letters
- Must contain at least one number
- Must contain at least one special character

### API Security
1. Always use HTTPS in production
2. Implement API versioning
3. Use request signing for webhooks
4. Validate all input data
5. Implement proper CORS configuration

### Database Security
1. Use parameterized queries (handled by Prisma)
2. Implement database backup encryption
3. Regular security updates for database software
4. Principle of least privilege for database users
5. Audit logging for data modifications

### File Upload Security
1. File type validation (whitelist approach)
2. File size limits (10MB default)
3. Virus scanning integration ready
4. Separate storage location from application
5. Generated unique filenames to prevent overwrites

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables set securely
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is strong and unique
- [ ] Database credentials are secure
- [ ] HTTPS configured and enforced
- [ ] Security headers enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive data

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Dependencies updated (npm audit)
- [ ] Security patches applied
- [ ] Access logs reviewed
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts monitored
- [ ] Database backups tested
- [ ] SSL certificates renewed
- [ ] Security audit performed quarterly

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Monitor logs for suspicious activity
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Investigation**: Analyze security logs
4. **Remediation**: Apply fixes and patches
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Documentation**: Document incident and response
